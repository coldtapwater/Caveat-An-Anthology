# The Divine Orders and Doctrines

> As handed down by the Scamurai herself, in a mix of questionable wisdom and yee-haw philosophy.

1. Thou Shalt Bump Thy Server

    for a server unbumped is a server forgotten. bump as though your very life depends on it—or at least your mod privileges.

2. Thou Shalt Not Insult Java

    java is sacred (to some). thou may complain about its verbosity, but thou shalt never call it inferior to python. null pointers are a feature, not a bug.

3. Thou Shalt Not Covet Another’s Banhammer

    the banhammer is mighty and terrifying. it is not for thy petty squabbles. wield it only in righteous fury—or for comedic effect with emoji.

4. Thou Shalt Honor Thy Google Translate

    when thou knowest not the words, turn to thy digital sensei. mistranslations are just part of the process. embrace them.

5. Thou Shalt Never Abandon Thy Print Statements

    for in debugging, the print statement is thy guiding light. when in doubt, print it out.

6. Thou Shalt Never Say, ‘Does It Run Doom?’

    not everything needs to run doom. not thy toaster, nor thy calculator, nor thy printer. ask not if it runs doom; accept it for what it is.

7. Thou Shalt Write Code That Works (Eventually)

    perfection is a fool’s errand. if thy code works on the third try and involves questionable practices, rejoice. for functional code is good code.

8. Thou Shalt Ask Questions Without Fear

    there are no stupid questions—only stupid answers. and caveat is full of those. ask anyway.

9. Thou Shalt Never Brag About Thy SQL Loops

    yes, sql has loops. no, thou art not a genius for discovering them. do not boast, lest ye be mocked eternally.

10. Thou Shalt Embrace the Yee and the Haw

    whether thou art writing scams in google translate or brute-forcing answers on the sat, do it with the spirit of texas: loud, proud, and just a little bit ridiculous. yee-haw forever.

*May these commandments guide you in your coding, scamming, and server moderation endeavors. Go forth, and bump with confidence.*
