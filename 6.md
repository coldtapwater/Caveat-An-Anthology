# Caveat: The Anthology

> ## Book 6: 
> Parental Guidance Suggested: An “Interview” with Caveat’s Parents

## Chapter 1: The Early Days – “She Was Born Bumping”

“from the moment she came into this world, we knew she was… different,” caveat’s mom begins, sipping tea and staring into the middle distance like she’s in a crime documentary. “most babies cry, but caveat? no. she made this weird little noise—something like ‘bump bump bump.’ at first, we thought it was cute. now? well…” she trails off, shaking her head.

her dad chimes in, “we tried to give her normal toys, you know? dolls, blocks, a ti-84 calculator like every other kid gets. but no. she’d ignore them and start messing with the wi-fi router. once, she reprogrammed the thermostat to say ‘rust > c.’ ... she was four.”

“honestly, we didn’t know where it came from,” her mom adds. “we’re not even tech people. but somehow, she just… knew things. like, when she made her first scam email? we thought she was playing make-believe. turns out, she scammed the neighbor’s kid out of five bucks using google translate. said it was for ‘samurai training.’”

her dad sighs. “that’s when we realized we were in for a ride.”

## Chapter 2: The Great Yee-Haw Awakening

“moving to texas changed everything,” her mom says, lowering her voice like she’s sharing state secrets. “we thought it’d be a fresh start, you know? a simpler life. but instead, she started saying ‘yee-haw’ ironically, and then it just… wasn’t ironic anymore.”

“she bought a cowboy hat,” her dad whispers, like he still can’t believe it. “a pink one. wore it while programming. said it helped her think. i tried to take it away once, and she reprogrammed the garage door to only open if you shouted ‘yee-haw.’ i had to call a technician to reset it.”

her mom shakes her head. “it was around this time she started calling herself a ‘scamurai.’ said she was blending her ‘japanese heritage’ with texas culture. which… okay, let’s be clear, she’s not japanese. i don’t know where she got that from.”

“google translate,” her dad says flatly. “she literally made up a whole persona using google translate. i walked in on her once practicing japanese phrases while holding a stick she called her ‘katana of justice.’ she was trying to convince someone on discord to send her bitcoin.”

“to reclaim her roots,” her mom adds with a grimace. “or so she said.”

## Chapter 3: The Java Betrayal

“oh, the rust vs. java thing?” her mom rolls her eyes. “don’t get me started. she used to talk about it like it was some great moral conflict. ‘java is reliable!’ she’d shout. ‘rust is overhyped!’ we didn’t even know what rust was.”

“one thanksgiving,” her dad interjects, “she stood up at the table, held her laptop over her head, and said, ‘java is the crocs of programming languages: ugly but practical.’ then she sat back down like that was normal.”

“the thing is,” her mom continues, “she didn’t hate rust. she just liked stirring the pot. said it made the rust evangelics ‘fun to annoy.’ once, she posted a picture of herself holding a ‘java forever’ sign in a rust subreddit. i thought the internet was going to implode.”

her dad nods. “she even made us take a family photo with her holding that sign. we didn’t know what it meant. we just smiled.”

## Chapter 4: The Debugging Years

“if there’s one thing she loved more than programming,” her mom says, “it was breaking things. then fixing them. but mostly breaking them first.”

her dad laughs. “she called it ‘debugging practice.’ we called it ‘why is the microwave flashing error codes?’”

“she was obsessed with print statements,” her mom adds. “everything was a print statement. once, she made the bathroom light flash ‘hello world’ when you turned it on. it was funny the first time. the hundredth time? not so much.”

“but she always figured it out,” her dad says, a hint of pride sneaking into his voice. “even when she didn’t know what she was doing, she’d just keep trying. she’d say, ‘if it works, it works,’ and honestly? it usually did.”

## Chapter 5: The Server Era – Bumps, Bans, and Chaos

“her life revolved around that server,” her mom says. “she’d wake up, bump the server, ban someone, then bump it again. it was like a ritual.”

“she once banned me from our home wi-fi,” her dad says, deadpan. “she said it was for ‘violating the terms of service.’ i just wanted to check the weather.”

her mom laughs. “and the bumping? don’t even get me started. if she forgot to bump, she’d freak out. one time, she woke up at 3 a.m. yelling, ‘i forgot to bump!’ ran to her computer like the house was on fire.”

“we didn’t understand it,” her dad admits. “but she seemed happy. and honestly, if bumping and banning trolls is what keeps her grounded, who are we to judge?”

## Chapter 6: The Scamurai Legacy

“the samurai-cowgirl thing is still going strong,” her mom says with a sigh. “she’s convinced it’s her ‘brand.’ i told her brands are for cattle, and she said, ‘exactly.’ i don’t even know what that means.”

“she tried to teach me japanese once,” her dad says. “it was just google translate reading phrases at me while she held up flashcards with cowboy hats on them. i didn’t learn anything, but she seemed really into it.”

“she’s not very good at scamming,” her mom confesses. “but she’s persistent. she once spent four hours trying to convince someone to send her bitcoin in exchange for a ‘limited edition katana barbecue set.’ they didn’t buy it, but she said the effort was ‘spiritually rewarding.’”

her dad chuckles. “she might not be good at scamming, but she’s great at making people laugh. and honestly? that’s kind of its own skill.”

## Chapter 7: The SAT Brute Force Incident

“we thought she was studying,” her mom begins, her voice tinged with the weariness of a parent who has seen too much. “she had her calculator, her notebooks, everything. we thought, ‘oh, she’s really taking this seriously.’”

her dad shakes his head. “turns out, she wrote a program on her ti-84 to brute force the answers. on the SAT.”

“‘it’s not cheating,’ she said,” her mom adds, rolling her eyes. “‘it’s optimizing.’ optimizing! can you believe that?”

her dad smirks. “she ended up scoring well, though. not because of the program—no, the program crashed halfway through. she just guessed. said it was a ‘heuristic solution.’”

“she even bragged about it later,” her mom says. “‘if you can’t solve the problem, make the problem solve itself,’ she told her little brother. now he’s trying to brute force his math homework. thanks, caveat.”

## Chapter 8: The Great Family Ban of 2021

“it started as a joke,” her dad says. “she kept saying we weren’t following ‘server rules.’ i didn’t even know we had server rules.”

her mom sighs. “next thing we know, she’s walking around the house with a clipboard, writing us up for ‘infractions.’ left a plate in the sink? warning. took too long in the bathroom? temp ban. it got ridiculous.”

“she banned the dog,” her dad says, clearly still not over it. “she banned the dog from the backyard. said he violated terms of service by ‘digging without admin approval.’”

“the final straw was when she tried to ban me from the kitchen,” her mom adds, crossing her arms. “i told her if she wanted dinner, she’d better revoke that ban real fast.”

“she called it ‘mod privileges abuse,’” her dad says with a chuckle. “but she backed down eventually. still, to this day, the dog gives her the side-eye every time she walks by.”

## Chapter 9: The Katana BBQ Saga

“the katana barbecue thing was supposed to be a joke,” her mom says, rubbing her temples. “but somehow, it got out of hand.”

her dad jumps in. “she said, ‘imagine a grill where the skewers are actual katanas.’ we thought, ‘oh, that’s funny.’ next thing we know, she’s emailing random companies in japan asking if they want to ‘invest.’”

“she even mocked up a prototype,” her mom says, holding up her phone to show a blurry photo of a grill with toy swords sticking out of it. “it looked like something a kindergartner would make in art class. but she was so proud.”

“someone actually replied to one of her emails,” her dad says, shaking his head. “not to invest, but to tell her to stop emailing them. she framed the email. called it her ‘first rejection letter.’”

## Chapter 10: The Final Straw (or Stick)

“there was a stick,” her mom starts, her voice heavy with resignation. “she called it her ‘katana of justice.’ it wasn’t even a stick—it was a broom handle she sawed the end off of.”

“she kept it by her desk,” her dad says. “said it was for ‘mod enforcement.’ anytime someone annoyed her on the server, she’d wave it around like she was some kind of samurai. once, she accidentally knocked over her monitor. blamed it on ‘server trolls.’”

“the worst was when she brought it to thanksgiving,” her mom says, burying her face in her hands. “she stood up in the middle of dinner, holding that stupid stick, and announced, ‘the yee-haw shall rise again!’ we didn’t even know what she meant. nobody knew what she meant.”

her dad shrugs. “she’s… unique. what can we say?”

“i’ll tell you what we can say,” her mom replies, glaring. “next thanksgiving, no sticks allowed.”

## Epilogue: The Parental Verdict

“look, she’s not perfect,” her mom says, leaning back in her chair. “she bumps too much, bans too easily, and still insists that java is better than rust, which is just… objectively wrong.”

“but she’s ours,” her dad adds with a shrug. “and you know what? we’re proud of her. even if she scams people in google translate and made our garage door shout ‘yee-haw.’”

“she’s not just a programmer,” her mom says. “she’s a scamurai, a bump queen, and a java apologist all rolled into one. and honestly? the world’s a little more interesting because of her.”

“it’s hard to explain caveat to people who haven’t met her,” her mom says, smiling despite herself. “she’s chaotic, she’s ridiculous, and sometimes she makes us want to pull our hair out.”

“but she’s also brilliant,” her dad adds. “and funny. and weirdly good at convincing people to do things they absolutely shouldn’t.”

“we don’t always understand her,” her mom admits. “but we love her. even if she brings a stick to thanksgiving.”
