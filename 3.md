## Chapter 1: A Million Questions and A Two-Million-Dollar Plan

“answering questions is fun,” caveat declared confidently, as though this statement wouldn’t immediately come back to haunt them. the discord chat buzzed with the endless queries of coding hopefuls and curious onlookers, and caveat, ever the dutiful staff member, was ready to help. sort of.

it started innocently enough—questions about tech classes, programming advice, maybe the occasional existential crisis about whether to learn haskell or clojure. “guys, should i learn haskell or clojure?” caveat asked one day, fully prepared to ignore all advice and do whatever felt least logical. “both feel wacky and unnatural to my java-pilled brain.” functional programming languages? weird. unsettling. probably a cult.

but then things escalated. “is this a paid position?” caveat joked, eyes narrowing at the mention of hiring. as always, the answer was no. naturally, caveat followed up with a question that was equal parts chaos and desperation: “do you accept bribes then?” they didn’t mean it. probably. but it’s hard to tell when someone immediately asks, “how many do you want?”

the negotiations continued. “that’s like… two million dollars,” caveat joked, their poker face flawless, their bank account weeping. “🙏 please give this unemployed teenager a $2mil loan 🙏,” they added, clearly hoping the discord gods were feeling generous.

when the conversation inevitably spiraled into cryptocurrency territory, caveat’s patience ran thin. “what do you even need 27btc for?” they asked, as if any answer could possibly justify such an absurd request.

## Chapter 2: Bumps, Bans, and Evil Pets

if there’s one thing caveat took seriously, it was bumping the server on disboard. “bump done!” they announced triumphantly, like a hero returning from battle. the server, of course, didn’t care, but caveat bumped anyway. because someone had to.

but bumps weren’t the only thing on caveat’s mind. there was also the banhammer. “BAN 🛠️,” they declared, slamming down imaginary authority with the enthusiasm of someone who’d just discovered their power. whether the ban was justified? irrelevant. the hammer had spoken.

amidst the chaos, caveat found time to admire a photo of someone’s pet. “she looks evil, i love her,” they commented, the highest praise one could receive from the discord staff. “oh, he? mb.” misgendering pets is a serious crime, but caveat brushed it off with their signature charm.

## Chapter 3: Calculators, Tests, and Brute Force Genius

“does it run doom?” caveat asked, staring at what was definitely a calculator and definitely not capable of running anything remotely close to doom. it was a ti-84, the kind of calculator every student either loved or loathed. “i had a ti-84 tho,” caveat reminisced, their voice dripping with nostalgia and trauma.

but caveat wasn’t just here to reminisce—they were here to innovate. “you can make programs that help you with stuff,” they explained, casually dropping the fact that they’d written programs to brute force answers on the SAT. “i didn’t know how to solve some problems, so i wrote programs to brute force the answer lmao.” genius? absolutely. questionable ethics? also yes.

standardized tests, though, were a nightmare. “act seems soo hard,” caveat muttered, their disdain for the science section practically palpable. “math is always hardest,” they added, cementing their belief that numbers were the root of all evil.

but english? “easiest language,” they said confidently. “i only know english,” they added, as though that somehow validated their opinion.

## Chapter 4: Functional Programming and The Great Divide

learning haskell or clojure was still on the table, but caveat wasn’t convinced. “both feel wacky and unnatural to my java-pilled brain,” they repeated, their skepticism growing with every passing second. functional programming? a black hole of confusion and cult-like devotion.

still, caveat couldn’t resist the allure of the unknown. “is this worth it?” they asked, knowing full well the answer was probably no. but when has that ever stopped anyone?

## Chapter 5: SQL, Blackjack, and The Art of Trying

“omg sql has loops??” caveat gasped, their world momentarily shaken by the revelation. loops in sql? unthinkable. “that’s actually a good idea, thanks,” they added, quickly recovering from their shock and claiming the idea as their own.

but sql wasn’t the only thing on caveat’s mind. there was also blackjack. “this code is theoretically able to shuffle a deck of cards,” caveat explained, their confidence wavering as they admitted the code only worked on a “small scale.” “it’s just too slow to shuffle the whole deck,” they confessed, blaming the interpreters rather than their “crap code.”

“i tried,” they added, a solemn conclusion to a project that deserved better but got what it got.

## Chapter 6: Cats, Memes, and Internet Trust Issues

the internet is a strange and treacherous place, and caveat knew this better than anyone. “you’re telling me everyone on the internet isn’t inherently trustworthy?” they asked, their sarcasm so sharp it could cut glass.

but even caveat wasn’t immune to a good cat meme. “this should be an emote,” they declared, staring at a photo of a cat doing something vaguely illegal.

amidst the chaos, caveat maintained their signature charm: a mix of sarcasm, curiosity, and just enough chaos to keep things interesting. because that’s what the internet is all about.

## Epilogue: The Legacy of Caveat

caveat doesn’t just exist in discord—they define it. a living, breathing enigma of staff responsibilities, existential humor, and the occasional threat of a banhammer. their legacy isn’t measured in solved coding challenges or brilliant programming advice (because let’s be real, sometimes it’s just chaos). it’s measured in moments. the little ones, like finding a meme-worthy cat. the big ones, like negotiating a two-million-dollar bribe they were never serious about (probably).

it’s not that caveat is the hero of discord—they’d never claim that. but they’re definitely the chaotic neutral energy every server needs: ready to bump at a moment’s notice, call out the absurdity of functional programming, or write sql code that may or may not involve loops.

if discord is a digital jungle, then caveat is the guide who doesn’t have a map but still somehow gets you there—eventually. their story isn’t about answers; it’s about trying. it’s about bumping the server, banning with flair, and saying, “i tried,” even when things don’t work out.

because at the end of the day, caveat isn’t here to win. they’re here to make it interesting. and honestly, isn’t that better?
