## Chapter 1: The Reluctant Crusader

why rust? why anything, really?
for caveat, it wasn’t about choice—it was destiny. or a cruel joke. same difference. they didn’t wake up one day and think, “i’m going to be an evangelist for a programming language that half the internet ignores and the other half can’t even spell.” no, they stumbled into it, like a drunk tripping over a curb.

“this server… it’s different,” caveat muttered, cautiously poking at the metaphorical campfire of online discourse. for the first time, someone, somewhere, didn’t immediately shut down the mere mention of rust. finally, a place where they weren’t the lone voice in the void yelling, “it’s memory safe!”

but evangelizing wasn’t easy. c stood like an ancient monolith, unmoved by the winds of progress, while python danced around, smugly declaring itself the easy one. and then there was rust, the scrappy underdog that wasn’t here to make friends but to conquer bugs with sheer determination and anger. caveat loved it, of course, because what else does a person with a masochistic love of obscure languages do?

the crusade began: stats, numbers, random github links. “it’s the 25th most popular language!” caveat proclaimed, as if that was a good thing. people will come around, they told themselves, like a prophet preaching to an empty room. and maybe they would. eventually.

but caveat didn’t just preach—they built. or, well, tried to build. their grand project? a language inspired by the chaos of brainfuck but somehow even more unnecessary. “it’s a superset,” they explained to themselves, the kind of pride that comes from making something nobody asked for. did it work? kind of. sometimes. okay, maybe not. “does it just crash?” they wondered, equal parts laughing and crying. spoiler: yes.

still, belief carried them forward. “believe,” they whispered like a cult leader to their own reflection. with llvm looming like a boss fight they weren’t ready for, and their half-baked language barely clinging to life, caveat pressed on. because if chaos isn’t an opportunity, what even is it?

## Chapter 2: The Compiler Conundrum

making a compiler backend is like deciding to climb everest. without shoes. or oxygen. caveat, naturally, thought, “yeah, that sounds fun.”

“even a basic transpiler is cool,” they reasoned, squinting at a blank editor like it owed them money. “everything starts somewhere,” they added, as if pep-talking themselves would make the llvm documentation less terrifying. spoiler: it didn’t.

the data—supposedly their ally—betrayed them immediately. “my data is freaking out,” caveat muttered, staring at their screen as files barely minutes old decided to stage a rebellion. but caveat wasn’t one to quit. “when’s release?” they joked, knowing full well the answer was “not in this lifetime.”

llvm, the beast itself, loomed large. its complexity was legendary, its intimidation factor off the charts. but caveat pressed forward, not because they were ready, but because what else were they going to do? give up? ha.

and then, a distraction: javascript. “i don’t get the javascript hate,” they mused, defending the language like it was a beloved pet that occasionally bit strangers. sure, javascript was messy, confusing, and responsible for more tears than bad breakups, but it was theirs. “it keeps me on my toes,” caveat added, as though errors were part of the charm.

## Chapter 3: The CS Chaos and Short People Conspiracy

if there was one thing caveat excelled at, it was asking unnecessary questions. “what if i just showed up to a random cs lecture?” they wondered, their inner chaos whispering, “do it, you coward.” it wasn’t out of character. caveat thrived on the absurd.

but the real chaos was in their observations. “every computer engineer i know is a twink,” they declared one day, as though this was a fact backed by peer-reviewed studies. “probably gay,” they added, nodding solemnly at their own hypothesis.

then came the dark memories. the trauma. the short people. “short people will tear you apart… emotionally,” caveat muttered, their voice tinged with the kind of regret that only comes from dating someone who’s 5’4”. “worst decision ever,” they concluded, their tone a PSA for anyone thinking of getting involved with compact emotional wrecking balls.

but no amount of short people trauma could stop the philosophical spirals. “what’s the difference between pure and impure?” caveat asked one night, clearly hoping someone had a ted talk ready. “that makes every language impure, doesn’t it?” they concluded, their worldview crumbling under the weight of their own thoughts.

and then, web dev. “trying to center a div almost killed me today,” caveat confessed, the scars of css battles still fresh. flexbox was both their savior and their tormentor, a love-hate relationship that defined their web development journey.

but there was hope. nostalgia, even. they unearthed the source code for their first-ever webpage. “not great code,” they admitted, cringing at their past self’s choices, “but an okay reference.” it was a relic of a simpler time, before llvm, before divs, before the short people conspiracy.

## Epilogue: The Evangelist’s Creed

why caveat? why this anthology?
because sometimes, the internet produces a soul so chaotic, so absurd, that it demands to be documented. caveat isn’t just a programmer. they’re a vibe. a lifestyle. a series of questionable decisions strung together with duct tape and caffeine.

whether it’s rust evangelism, compiler chaos, or the eternal war against css, caveat embodies the messy, glorious process of making stuff just to see if you can. they’re not a hero. they’re not a villain. they’re the person in the server screaming “believe!” while everything is on fire.

so, what’s next? who knows. maybe they’ll conquer llvm. maybe they’ll declare war on short people. or maybe, just maybe, they’ll figure out how to center a div without losing their sanity.

until then, they’ll be here: coding, questioning, and reminding us all that sometimes, the real beauty in programming is the madness along the way.

welcome to caveat’s world. we’re glad you’re here. bring snacks.
